# React-Vite-TailwindCSS-TypeScript-ShadcnUI Starter Template

This template is your starting point for building web applications with a powerful stack combining React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and ShadcnUI. It is designed to offer developers a seamless development experience with fast builds, modern styling, strong typing, and high-quality UI components.

## Features

-   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces with efficient, declarative, and flexible components.
-   **Vite**: A next-generation frontend tooling environment that offers lightning-fast server start, hot module replacement (HMR), and optimized build outputs.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs without having to leave your HTML.
-   **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, bringing static type-checking along with the latest ECMAScript features.
-   **ShadcnUI**: A modern React UI library that provides a comprehensive suite of high-quality components that are easy to customize and extend.
